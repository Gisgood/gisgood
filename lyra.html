                            Lyra is a comprehensive ecosystem that includes a Chain, Protocol, Exchange, and Wallet, designed to facilitate capital-efficient and composable perpetual and options trading on ERC-20 tokens.
                            <br><br>
                            Lyra is airdropping free LDX to celebrate the launch of their new protocol. The team is also migrating from their old token to a new token called “LDX.” This airdrop is for traders, yield farmers, and the participants will be rewarded with free points for trading, depositing and inviting friends.

                            <strong>Step-by-Step Guide:</strong><br>
                            1. Visit the Lyra website.<br>
                            2. Sign in with your email, Google account, or wallet.<br>
                            3. To start earning points, you should enter our code “QUEPK” and deposit at least $25.<br>
                            4. Now you can earn free points for trading, depositing, and inviting friends.<br>
                            5. You can also earn LDX by holding LYRA.<br>
                            6. Firstly, you can earn 250 points per $1 fee paid on options and perps trades.<br>
                            7. Secondly, you can earn 1 point per $100 deposited to Lyra per hour.<br>
